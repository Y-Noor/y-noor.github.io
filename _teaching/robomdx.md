Highschool students were invited to Middlesex University Mauritius during their school holidays and were given an introdution to various electronic parts as well as to the arduino language. It was a 3 day event and they had to apply their newly obtained knowledge to build a line following robot. On the third day, the different robots will have competed against each other until the fastest robot has been determined.
