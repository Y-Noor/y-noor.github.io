Hello! I am Noor, a [frog who is trying to escape his well](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780199539536.001.0001/acref-9780199539536-e-861#:~:text=The%20frog%20in%20the%20well%20knows%20nothing%20of%20the%20sea&text=Japanese%20proverb%2C%20meaning%20that%20one,limitations%20of%20one's%20own%20experience.). My research interests lie in AI, robotics and the application of web3 technologies, where I explore the innovations and breakthroughs of yesterday, today and tomorrow. I am passionate about understanding the inner workings of our world at a fundamental level and strive to perpetually improve the current iteration of myself relative to the previous one. Some of my other areas of interests are cognitive sciences, philosophy, psychology and linguistics.

With a background in [Your Educational Background or Relevant Experience], I bring [Specific Skills or Expertise] to my work. I have [Brief Mention of Any Notable Achievements, Awards, or Publications].

In addition to my research, I am committed to giving back through teaching and mentoring initiatives. I try my best to share the knowledge and experiences I have accumulated over the years with my students while providing a platform to promote continuous learning, foster empathy and understanding among them, no matter who they are. As a neat bonus, teaching makes me become accountable towards my students so I have to always be up to date and correct about whatever I am sharing with the students. 

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my work, publications, and projects. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please don't hesitate to contact me.
